# Quick Facts

<div class="fade">

<v-clicks>

- since 2012 (current version 0.19.1)
- purely functional, static typed language
- syntax similar to Haskell, but easier
- single purpose language for Frontend Development
- inspiration for Redux

# Ecosystem

|            |                                               |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| elm        | compiler                                      |
| elm-format | opinionated formatter                         |
| elm-test   | testing framework for examples and properties |
| elm-live   | better dev server with hot reload             |

install by `npm i <tool> -g`

# Example

```elm
isEven : Int -> Bool
isEven x = remainderBy 2 x == 0

pow2 : Int -> Int
pow2 x = x^2

List.range 1 10 
  |> List.filter isEven 
  |> List.map pow2
-- [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

# How to mutate state?

```elm
counter = counter + 1
```

<v-click>

<carbon-arrow-right /> Does not compile!

> ...
> 
> The `counter` value is defined directly in terms of itself, 
> causing an infinite
> loop.
> 
> Are you are trying to mutate a variable? Elm does not have mutation, so when I
> see counter defined in terms of counter, I treat it as a recursive definition.
> Try giving the new value a new name!
>

# Functional approach

```elm
type alias Model = Int

inc : Model -> Model
inc counter = counter + 1
```

<v-click>

more generic version

```elm
type alias Model = { counter : Int }
type Msg = Increment

update : Msg -> Model -> Model
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Increment -> { model | counter = model.counter + 1 }
```
